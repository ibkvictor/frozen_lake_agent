Programming contests usually consist of programming problems, which have problem statements like this one.

Each problem statement usually consists of:

Problem Statement
Input and Output Format
Sample Input and Output
A problem statement describes the task that you need to accomplish.

The input format describes the format that the input will be given in. These are usually written formally and often contain constraints: that is, you can assume that the input will respect certain constraints. You can see an example of this below.

The output format describes the format that you should output your answers. These are also written formally, and must be respected exactly. That is, there should be no extraneous whitespace and no extra messages such as Type the number: or Input the integers.

The sample input and output will contain (usually one, but sometimes multiple) testcases, or input that your program will be tested against. The correct output is predetermined and your program's output must be the same as the predetermined correct output. The testcases also give an example of how the input or output format should look like.

Note that the sample input and output are not the only testcases your program will be checked against. There are also other secret testcases that your program will be tested on. The input and output of these testcases are usually not given, and you will only be informed if your program passes (got the right answer) or not (couldn't compile, crashed, took too long, wrong answer, wrong format, and so on). Since you don't know the secret input, you need to write a program that gives the correct answer for any input that respects the constraints.

Generally, no partial points are awarded for passing only some testcases. Your program should pass all the secret testcases to get the points.

Input and output as you would normally (standard input and standard output). Unless otherwise stated, do not read from or write to a file.

In this problem, you should write a program that takes two integers and outputs their product.

Input Format

The first and only line of input contains two integers,  and  ).

This means that you can assume that all of the input files will contain exactly two integers not less than  and not greater than . None of the input will violate the contraints or format.

Output Format

Output a single integer, the product of the two numbers.

You should not output any unnecessary whitespace or prompt messages.

Sample Input

3 7
Sample Output

21
Explanation

7 multiplied by 3 is 21, so that should be the output.
